    <h1>Compactness</h1>
    <p>
        So I decided to do a thing about compactness I'm not sure what I'm gonna
        write here entirely but I find some of this stuff kinda interesting so I
        wanted to write what I find here and see if I can find any cool
        applications for this.

    <h2>What is Compactness</h2>
    <img src="../static/compact_set_non_compact.png"/>
    <p>
        There's a bunch of various lemmas and definitions of compactness
        essentially imagine some set A defined on metric space X the set A is
        compact if there's no sequence in A which escapes it i.e. there's no
        holes or any other funny business going on with this set. For finite
        dimensional euclidean space this is just a closed and bounded set but
        more generally it's defined for any metric space as a generalization of
        this idea. Imagine some ball S that has no holes and a solid border any
        sequence in S has no way of escaping where as T has all these holes if a
        sequence enters one of these holes it can get out of T thus it's not
        compact.

    <h2>A Note</h2>
    <p>
        As I find new applications I will add them here because I think there's
        a bunch of applications.

    <h2>Applications in Graph Coloring</h2>
    <p>
        We say that if a graph `G` is compact there's some set of finite
        subgraphs which may be colored using `k` colors we can color `G` with
        `k` colors. I wonder if the results of a SDE will be compact... if
        that's true then there's something we can say about the subset on S
        in terms of maximum and minimum values
