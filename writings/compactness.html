    <h1>Compactness</h1>
    <p>
        So I decided to do a thing about compactness I'm not sure what I'm gonna
        write here entirely but I find some of this stuff kinda interesting so I
        wanted to write what I find here and see if I can find any cool
        applications for this. Starting off Compactness as a concept is a
        generalization of a closed and bounded set in Euclidean space [1] we can
        find uses all over maths, now I want to take some random thing and apply it here
